# hi
A project meant to elegantly print the output "hi" onto a terminal, works on Windows and Linux.
Run in a terminal environment, emulator, tty, I dont care.

hi.sh is the Linux build and its source code in raw text on one file.

hi.bat is the Windows build and its source code in raw text on one file.

a new version (hi_windowed.bat) has been added to the repo, it opens a window that says hi using a temporary vbscript file, its the Windows_windowed build and its source code in raw text on one file.

hi_windowed should work on systems as old as Windows 95 but Windows 95 may need the Windows Script Host tool installed to work properly.

I am unsure the minimal version for the command line hi build for Windows.
